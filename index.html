      <h1>Creating a Floating Island with Plastic Foam</h1>
      <p class="smallfont">This is an outline design for a floating island. While the design is speculative, the basic materials and components are all available or feasible to build with now, though not using waste materials and not to the specification described here. You can get an overview of this design by following the images, or you can get a fuller view from the associated text and links, especially <a href="How2BuiIslPg1.html">Rationale, Ideas and Design</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1UxSwLLs-8">Video of Harbour Approach</a>. Enjoy!</p>

      <p>Foam artifacts include buoys, pontoons, marinas, lifeboats, floating docks and platforms and even remedial bio-islands for improving water quality!</p>

      <h2>FAR: Floating Artificial Reef</h2><a href="IslandWebPg3.html"><img src="images/FltgArtReef.PNG" alt="should be an artificial reef.."> Artificial Reef</a>
      <p>Artificial reefs are used to improve marine habitats with shelter and nutrient traps; a floating version would also provide a breakwater similar to salt marshes and mangroves</p>

      <h2>A Village for the Island</h2><a href="IslandWebPg5.html"><img src="images/Village.JPG" alt="should be a village for the island.."> Village Construction</a>
      <p>A possible design for providing living space on the island, made with standard foam modules and providing the marine equivalent of the village square..</p>

      <h2>From FARs to Artificial Islands</h2><a href="IslandWebPg4.html"><img src="images/Island3.PNG" alt="should be an artificial island.."> Artificial Island</a>
      <p>FARs could be extended to provide residential and recreational space, creating floating islands to counter land loss from erosion and rising sea levels</p>
