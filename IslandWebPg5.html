                 Village Harbour</a>
  <p>
Having a harbour in the centre of the village reflects the importance of boats in village life, with most journeys within the Island and between it and adjacent coastal communities made by boat. Having marinas in the villages decreases both pressure on the central harbour and the need to have more complex mooring facilities for residences, reducing the complexity of residential construction

          <h2>Village Plazas</h2>

                 Village Plazas</a>
  <p>
Public open spaces not taken up with specific uses such as agriculture and boat services are at a premium on the Island, so plazas provide for this need to hang out and relax, the only other easily accessible public space being the harbour front, which is very busy as a central services and distribution hub

  <p>
All Island structures have to contend with wind and waves and the storms that combine them, so a structure which is intrinsically resistant to these is highly desirable, and the best design we have for this is the geodesic dome, so weather-resistant domes are used for shopping, administration and recreation, as well as homes

                 A Village</a>
  <p>
'Villages' are the community centres of the Island, containing public spaces and facilities for social and administrative activities, as well as a mix of shopping and recreational facilities which may vary from village to village. Some central organisation may be based in the harbour front but most organisation is decentralised between the villages: then again, this is a flexible structure and Islanders will decide for themselves where they want things to happen...
