<h2>How to Build an Island: DESIGN</h2>


<p>
<strong>The Overall Design Approach</strong>: To use long-lived modular components made from buoyant and tough but cheap materials, which are easily extended and maintained.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The starting point</strong> is large (ish) high-buoyancy rafts on top of which everything else is placed. Perhaps the simplest practicable design is to have just two buoyancy units (plus modules for area cover/residential domes/greenhouses etc., which sit on top of the buoyancy units), one shaped like a shoe-box, the SPAR, and the other like a wedge of cheese, the CORNER, to connect SPARs together. From these you can construct, e.g. triangular and hexagonal rings of SPARs/CORNERs, or almost any other shape.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Some Design Issues/Constraints</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: the Island is a highly modular structure, easily assembled from simple components made from strong and durable materials; the use of standardised parts applies at all scales from unit components such as ropes and netting to the buoyancy platforms (SPARs, CORNERs plus space-covering tarpaulins) on which everything sits to bridges, geodesic domes and even much larger structures such as Rings and Villages</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Loose coupling</strong>: modules need to be strongly yet loosely coupled to absorb wave energy (including storm waves!) without incurring long-lasting damage (i.e. no more than readily repaired wear and tear). By attaching hawsers to the sides of SPARs and CORNERs, and building walkways with flexible joins (e.g. rope/net walks), the shape of structures can be strongly held while still allowing individual units to move and absorb wave energy; this would be enhanced with inertial damping provided by the water anchors attached to every buoyancy unit. Provision of unit-to-unit energy absorption could be as simple as tyre nets</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>'Weather' resistance</strong>: for people to live comfortably on a floating island it will be necessary to ameliorate the effects of constant wave and wind action, including reducing the impact of storms and heavy swells (this also applies to harboured boats and the islands own structures!); so all permanent structures need to  keep the 'sail' effect low by presenting minimal obstruction to the wind, which can be done in two ways:
</p>
<p>
using <strong>low-rise construction</strong>, avoiding tall or multi-storey buildings, which would require more buoyancy than the buoyancy platforms proposed could provide anyway;
</p>
<p>
and using <strong>wind-deflecting surfaces</strong>, i.e. curved rather than flat and smooth rather than rough surfaces, the ideal structure in that case being a smooth sphere, and the most practical version of that being a smooth-skinned geodesic dome or dome cap. Similarly the ideal shape for the whole island would be circular, but a simpler and more practical shape would be a hexagon or other regular polygon, with an outer protective ring as in the design proposed (see below)</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Island structures and marine life</strong>: building an Island which isn't inimical to marine life requires (at least) two things, keeping the surface density of building down, and allowing marine organisms to grow on the base of the Island ('fouling'):
</p>
<p>
<strong>high versus low surface density</strong>: as island size increases it may be tempting to increase the density of surface structures to keep total size and travel distance down, but beneath the island is a living ecology whose productivity we wish to encourage, for which a minimum level of light penetration beneath island structures is necessary, so moves to decrease the proportion of open water will have to be resisted!
</p>
<p>
<strong>'fouling' resistance</strong>: modules need to be functionally impervious to the build-up of marine organisms, which is to be encouraged to improve marine productivity; attachment points which need to be kept clean or equipment which can be damaged or made inoperative by fouling needs to be elevated above the average daily level of the waves; generally, most expected uses of these structures won't be affected adversely by the build-up of marine organisms, which will improve the stability of structures by increasing their weight and hence inertia, as well as increasing marine productivity in their vicinity. Having said that, it is inevitable that some cleaning, i.e. removal of marine encrustation, will be needed!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>The Initial Design</h3>
<strong>The island</strong> would consist of a series of concentric rings surrounding a central harbour. The rings are of two types, those containing facilities for specific activities - <strong>activity rings</strong>, such as the inner harbour ring surrounding the central harbour, and transport rings - <strong>ringways</strong> - consisting of a 'canal' and roadway with bridges to allow boat access and vehicle crossing; ringways are provided as necessary for easy access to all areas (and to create open water between surface structures for marine growth).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Activity Rings</strong>, working from the harbour ring outwards, are:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Harbour Ring</strong>, which has several marinas attached, to contain moorings for small and medium-sized boats;</li>
<li><strong>The Boat Services Ring</strong> of boat maintenance and provisioning services at the  rear of the harbour ring (surrounded in turn by the first transport ringway);</li>
<li><strong>The Residential Ring</strong> of housing and 'village' centres, placed as near the centre as practicable for protection from heavy seas;</li>
<li><strong>The Agricultural Ring</strong> with greenhouses, hydroponics etc.;</li>
<li><strong> The Commercial/Industrial Ring</strong> with additional servicing, processing and warehousing facilities;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The final - <strong>Outer Ring</strong> - is a much wider one largely consisting of aquaculture areas for growing seaweeds and shellfish, with some associated structures and berthing facilities for larger boats; this outer ring has a secondary (though major) function of damping waves and storms to protect the inner facilities.
