<h2>How to Build an Island: FUNCTIONALITY</h2>

<p>
Though this initial design concentrates on basic materials and structure, there will also have to be a considerable amount of detailed functional design/development to create a working island with a resident population. Creating detailed prescriptions for specific functions seems premature before the design of the island itself is even complete (or even proscriptions against particular approaches); however, one issue that is important to the design of services for the island is centralisation:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Distributed versus centralised services</strong>: given that we are building our infrastructure on a highly mobile surface it's probably better to make services distributed, i.e. multiple small sources or activities based in physically limited locations, rather than have long pipes and cables, reservoirs, substations and other centralised paraphernalia liable to physical disruption; a further advantage of distributed services on  expanding (or multi-size) islands is the capacity for expansion without hitting major problems of scale.
</p>


<p>
Before we start we need a road map for functional artifacts that both provide primary services such as food, water, power and waste processing, and enable secondary services such as health, education and entertainment:
</p>

<h3>ROAD MAP</h3>

<ul>
<li>Food processing, storage and distribution</li>
<li>Clean and dirty water services</li>
<li>Energy generation, distribution and storage</li>
<li>Transport and communications</li>
<li>Health, security and other social services</li>
<li>Entertainment and educational services</li>
</ul>
