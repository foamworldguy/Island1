      <h2>The Central Harbour</h2><a href="Hrbr.html"><img src="images/CentralHrbrRng.png" alt="should be the central harbour.."> <h5>The Central Harbour</h5></a>
      <p>The central harbour protects boats from wave and storm damage and provides a trading hub and a staging area for boat repairs and refits carried out in the Boat Services Ring behind the harbour ring, with different marinas for small and medium-sized boats connected to the harbour front. It's the beating heart of the Island's maritime community, a social as well as a commercial centre</p>

      <h2>The Rings</h2><a href="IslandWebPg6.html"><img src="images/Rings1B.png" alt="should be the boat services ring.."> <h5>The Rings</h5></a>
      <p>The Island consists of nested rings around a central harbour. In the original hexagonal design each ring consists of six straight segments and carries out a specific activity, viz: the Inner Rings are the Harbour Front and Boat Services, which are enclosed by the Village residential ring, followed by the Agricultural Ring, and finally the outer Services and Aquaculture rings</p>

      <h2>A Prototype Island</h2><a href="Island.html"><img src="images/Island1B.png" alt="should be an Island.."> <h5>The Island</h5></a>
      <p>The symmetric design of the Island improves its resistance to storms and wave action generally and is an efficient way to organise the services necessary to human settlement such as food production/distribution and transport. Islands should have very long lives so it's important that they be resistant to sea conditions and easily maintained, both facilitated by a simple design using standard modules made of tough materials</p>
