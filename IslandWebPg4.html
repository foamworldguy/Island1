                 The Harbour</a>
  <p>
The Inner Harbour protects boats from wave and storm damage and provides a trading hub and a staging area for boat repairs and refits, with different marinas for small and medium-sized boats connected to the Boat Services Ring behind the harbour front. It's the beating heart of the Island's maritime community, a social as well as a commercial centre

                 Boat Services Ring</a>
  <p>
The Boat Services Ring has facilities for small and medium-sized boats, accessed from the Inner Harbour via the marinas or from the adjacent Residential Ring through the Ringway. It provides the usual boat repair and refit facilities through a series of dry docks and covered areas. People working here live in the  Residential Ring or commute by boat from a nearby coastal town via the Inner Harbour

                 The Ringway</a>
  <p>
Transportation Rings improve transport around the island for pedestrians, vehicles and boats. They combine a continuous circular road and a 'canal' (i.e. continuous open water), with bridges over the 'canal' to allow free movement of pedestrians (on separate walkways) and vehicular as well as water traffic. They are placed at strategic locations between the other Rings to reduce crowding on the water surface as well as facilitate movement

                 The Island</a>
  <p>
The symmetric design of the Island improves its resistance to storms and wave action generally and is an efficient way to organise the services necessary to human settlement such as food production/distribution and transport. Islands are intended to have very long lives so it's important that they be resistant to sea conditions and easily maintained, the latter facilitated by the simple modular design
