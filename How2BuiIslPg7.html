<h2>How to Build an Island: REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>
<strong>The IDEA</strong>: to efficiently build floating long-lived structures out of plastic foam and foam composites largely made from waste materials
</p>

<p>
This idea will be underpinned by some key concepts:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: short-lived, fragile, expensive and/or complex materials or designs are <strong>not</strong> sustainable, so the proposed structures have to be anti-obsolescent and conform to the KISC principle, viz, Keep It Simple & Cheap. Using materials and providing facilities efficiently - including enabling low maintenance, upgrade and extension costs - doesn't need to imply cheap and nasty, or simple and flimsy; a sensible approach would be to try to create a high-quality design utilising low-cost materials and techniques: think robust roundhouses made from sticks and mud (and a few stones)! </li>

</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Life-friendliness</strong>: this applies both to people and to marine organisms;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Being people-friendly</strong>: i.e. enable engagement, ownership and enjoyment by those who will be living with the technology day to day, as well as providing a safe and protective environment, the minimum requirement for which would be for all buoyancy units to be fitted with walkways and have climbable side-access with hand-holds, e.g. wide netting or rope ladders
</p>
<p>
<strong>Managing marine life</strong>: on and around island structures, as well as that originally living in the area (this is especially applicable to coastal installations) <strong>before</strong> construction began... As a general rule marine productivity, measured as total biomass, increases on and around structures added to shallow water or at the sea surface, particularly when accompanied by extra nutrients that are in short supply, such as the iron in sunken vessals</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The idea and concepts suggest a number of requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To maximise use of waste materials such as plastic, paper and glass, consistent with other requirements</li>
<li>The materials used (preferably <strong>all</strong> of them) have to be permanently buoyant, especially those used in support structures</li>
<li>Structures need to be strong and resilient to withstand long-term sea conditions</li>
<li>To work and even live on such structures they have to be chemically and physically stable</li>
<li>Structures will need to be very long-lived to justify their cost</li>
</ul>
<p>
Looking at these requirements in a little more detail:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Using waste materials</strong>: the proportion of waste material used would depend on several factors, such as the degree of sorting on collection, but at least for the inner high-buoyancy foam the specification, other than basics such as imperviousness to seawater penetration, is relatively lower, and higher levels of plastic or paper waste can probably be used; specifications such as strength and resilience can always be improved through incorporating composite materials such as glass fibre; ideally waste paper would be a major input but that will depend on suitable conversion processes</li>
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Buoyancy</strong>: creating a range of long-lived high-buoyancy foams for use in all structural components, especially the buoyancy modules themselves, is necessary both for the finished structure and during its construction; by making everything buoyant the spectre of dropping components into the water and watching them disappear into the depths is removed, and on-site construction or assembly in remote locations made more practicable</li>
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Strength and resilience</strong>: this is more about resilience and toughness than strength per se, except perhaps tensile strength in filaments; the model for Island structures is the palm tree, which bends before the storm and perhaps loses a few branches, but springs back when the storm is over and continues as strong as before (if not quite as good as new before regrowth occurs..), though a high-impact-resistence outer skin which incorporates additional high-toughness materials and composites is described in the Materials Section</li>
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Chemical stability</strong>: this includes resistance to solvents and acids/alkalies and UV resistance, but the most important form of chemical stability is of course fire resistance; all the foams to be produced, including those for filamental materials such as ropes, nets and fabrics, will need to have very high heat and flame resistance and low smoke production, which affects a number of aspects of their manufacture, as described in the Materials Section</li>
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Physical stability</strong>: there are several sources of physical stability used in this design: that deriving from <strong>basic design</strong> concepts, e.g. using geodesic domes, and connecting modules into inherently stable configurations such as high width-to-depth platforms and rings; having an outer 'dampening' ring of marine growth such as seaweed and suspended shellfish beds which acts like mangroves or salt marshes in absorbing wave energy; and fitting <strong>water anchors</strong> near the ends of SPARs to increase their effective weight and hence resistance to waves</li>
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: there are a number of implications to the need for very long life-spans for plastic materials, including toughness in use (i.e. wear resistance), and resistance to a range of aging factors, including chemicals (especially seawater), UV light (especially for the outer layers), and auto-catalysis; this last is a tendency in some (perhaps, long-term, all) plastics for their breakdown products to catalyse further degradation of the material, leading to further breakdown which may be slow at first but ultimately catastrophic (as experienced by some toy museums)</li>
