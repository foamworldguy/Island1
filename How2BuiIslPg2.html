<h2>How to Build and Island: MATERIALS</h2>

<p>
The materials we are concerned with here are plastic foams and plastic foam composites. Our starting point for these is waste materials such as plastics, paper and glass, with added virgin material, the proportion of the two depending on the foam specifications.
</p>
<p>
All of the foams and foam composites have to conform to a minimum specification:
<ul>
<li>A very high long-term resistance to seawater infiltration</li>
<li>(Permanent) buoyancy, i.e. start and remain lighter than seawater</li>
<li>High fire and flame resistance and low smoke production. This might be achieved by (probably plus other actions):
<ul>
<li>Formulating the plastic used for the foams to create basic resistance to fire and smoke production, e.g. by charring</li>
<li>Incorporating anti-oxidants and other fire/smoke/auto-catalysis retardents</li>
<li>Using an inert gas to blow the foam, such as argon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Additional specifications apply to the different types of foam required:
<ul>
<li><strong>Core foam</strong>: (For the cores of SPARs and CORNERs) Very light (i.e. low density) yet stiff and moderately strong, to provide the load-bearing capacity needed by the buoyancy modules; only moderate UV resistance and impact resistance is needed as the cores have a protective wrap</li>
<li><strong>Wrapping foam</strong>: (Wraps around the core of SPARs and CORNERs or other structures) flexible and medium density to absorb knocks without permanent deformation, protecting the core from damage; only moderate UV resistance, and impact resistance is provided by the Outer Skin, described below</li> 
<li><strong>Embedding foam</strong>: (Used to embed elements to create high-strength filaments and composites)flexible, tough and low-to-medium density, very high UV resistance, moderate impact resistance (impact resistance is supplied mostly by the embedded composite materials); highly adhesive before final setting to hold embedded materials in place</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Composite materials</strong>: There are two categories of these (initially at least): Outer Skin Composites, which, as their name suggests, provide a tough wrapping material to protect structures from the knocks and bumps endemic to marine existence, in particular they constitute the outer skin of SPARs and CORNERs; and Filamental Composites, which are used to create the wide range of tough and flexible materials typical in marine use. Taking these in turn:
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Outer skin composites</strong>: these use the Embedding Foam along with a matrix of either or both of a tough plastic such as one of the Nylons, or glass fibre, which might be chopped or long (optic) fibre, depending on the levels of flexibility, toughness and impact resistance required</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Filamental composites</strong>: these use the Embedding Foam too, but to wrap filaments of a tough plastic or glass fibre to create yarn for flexible and light yet strong ropes, nets, webbing and fabrics, including the use of continuous glass fibre, as in fibre-optics, to create super-strong materials for special uses, such as hawsers and space-covering tarpaulins</li>
</p>
</ul>
