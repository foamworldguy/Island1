      <h2>The Basic SPAR</h2><a href="SPARs.html"><img src="images/thumbspar.PNG" alt="should be a SPAR.."> The SPAR</a>
      <p>The SPAR is a large (8 x 4 x 3m depth) brick of high-strength foam used to provide buoyancy and a supporting surface for floating structures. Its core is rigid seawater-proof low-density foam, enclosed in a layer of tough elastic foam shaped to give rounded edges and corners, with an impact-resistant composite outer skin. Finally, the SPAR is covered with high-strength netting to enable it to be easily connected to other units and have other artifacts added such as handrails, walkways and, in particular, water anchors, one near each end, to improve inertial stability (i.e. resistance to waves!)</p>

      <h2>The Basic CORNER</h2><a href="CORNERs.html"><img src="images/thumbcorner.PNG" alt="should be a CORNER.."> The CORNER</a>
      <p>SPARs by themselves are limited in the shapes that can be formed from them; CORNERs are used to join SPARs together at angles of 60 or 120 degrees to enable rings and platforms of all shapes and sizes to be built. Though their composition, and hence buoyancy and strength, is the same as SPARs, CORNERs are only used to join SPARs and don't have water anchors, so depend on attached SPARs for stability.</p>

    <div id="middle2">
      <h2>SPARs and CORNERs</h2><a href="SsandCs.html"><img src="images/SsandCs3.png" alt="should be SPARs and CORNERs.."> SPARs and CORNERs</a>
      <p>SPARs and CORNERs can be combined to create rings, zigzags and many other structures; in particular Islands need some basic 'foundations' or platforms of arbitrary size on which to place accommodation, such as the bars, shops and businesses of village plazas, and build the 'rings' which create the island's structure, as well as breakwaters of arbitrary shape and extent used in both Islands and FARs</p>

      <h2>Floating Artificial Reef</h2><a href="AR4.html"><img src="images/wireZZ2.PNG" alt="should be a FAR.."> FAR</a>
      <p>FARs act as breakwaters, calming waves from tides and storms, and are designed to resist wave and storm damage to themselves as well as protect sections of coastline or coastal facilities. With time FARs will become coated in marine organisms - 'fouling' - which actually enhances their effectiveness by increasing their weight and hence resistance to wave action, gradually transforming them, especially in shallow waters, into something more like an ordinary reef</p>
