<h2>How to Build an Island: CONSTRUCTION</h2>

<p>
Initially such an island would be easier to construct, at least the major components, on a coast near centre/s of population, so that:
<ul>
<li>Waste and waste-processing facilities would be readily available</li>
<li>Land-based factories to manufacture basic components and modules would be more easily established</li>
<li>Construction could be organised to be less open to disruption from weather and sea conditions</li>
<li>If the 'kit' approach to building islands is taken (see below) then harbourage facilities would be needed for the large vessals used</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If islands are to be situated in remote areas (e.g. to replace or augment Pacific islands..) then two options seem available: viz. build an island and move it there, or take a kit of components and modules and put them together on-site; in more detail:
<ul>
<li><strong>Build and move</strong>: even if the drag of water anchors can be removed (leave empty or attach on site) this is not an easy option for an island of any significant size, this design doesn't really lend itself to movement, except excruciatingly slow movement, though there has to be some means to move to counter the effects of tides and currents</li>
<li><strong>Kit build</strong>: this looks like a more feasible option, especially as island components are designed to be highly modular and fit together in standard configurations; the lightness of components means that the largest of container ships could carry very large quantities of parts, minimising the number of journeys/ships needed, though unloading island components from such large vessals in open ocean would require some redesign..</li>
</ul>
