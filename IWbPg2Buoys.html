The traditional uses for buoys as markers and warnings still exist, though now using modern materials as described below, and often more active, e.g. with solar-powered lights. More complex buoys with onboard electronics are now of huge importance in activities such as weather forecasting, control of shipping lanes and ocean-related research, including tracking the effects of global warming.

<h3> Materials</h3>
Historical materials like wood, cork, metal and concrete have now been largely replaced by plastics, including composites and foams, with metal only used where extra strength is required, e.g. steps on large buoys.
<h3> Modules</h3>
, and for this expanded activity a wide range of sensors, data processing and transmission devices, and power systems (usually based on solar panels) are used, with a corresponding expansion of sizes and shapes
