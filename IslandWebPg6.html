      <h1>The Ring Structure of the Island</h1>
      <p class="smallfont">The ring design was chosen because it's simple to construct, optimises movement around the Island and, with people and structures concentrated in the centre, provides protection from waves and storms; this last is enhanced by the wider outermost rings containing energy-absorbing material in the form of seaweed and shellfish beds

      <h2>Inner Rings</h2><a href="HrbrRing.html"><img src="images/HrbrRingB.png" alt="should be the harbour ring.."> <h5>The Harbour Ring</h5></a>
      <p>The Harbour Front and Boat Services rings provide access and services for the Central Harbour. Boat Services has facilities for small and medium-sized boats, accessed from the Central Harbour via marinas or the adjacent Residential Ring. It provides boat repair and refit facilities in dry docks and covered areas. Workers live in the Residential Ring or commute by boat from a nearby coastal town via the Central Harbour</p>

      <h2>A Village for the Island</h2><a href="IslandWebPg5.html"><img src="images/VlgRingB.png" alt="should be a village for the island.."> <h5>Village Construction</h5></a>
      <p>A possible design for providing living space on the island, made with standard foam modules and providing the marine equivalent of the village square. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGetUf5PDr0">Video of Village Walkthrough</a>.</p>

      <h2>The Agricultural Ring</h2><a href="Agric.html"><img src="images/AgricRingB.png" alt="should be the Agricultural Ring.."> <h5>Agricultural Ring</h5></a>
      <p>This enables ordinary land crops to be grown with three special modules: hydroponic greenhouses, soil beds and 'green domes', large geodesic domes which can house full-size tree crops. Together with palms such as coconuts in separate planters these allow a range of crops to be grown.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="right">
      <h2>Outer Rings</h2><a href="OuterRings.html"><img src="images/seaweed5sma.jpg" alt="should be a FAR.."> <h5>Outermost</h5></a>
      <p>The Outer Services Ring houses commercial, professional, processing and warehousing activities; the two large outermost rings are for aquaculture, mainly seaweeds and shellfish beds, though there will also be shoals of fish living under and around the Island, enabling small-scale fishing</p>
