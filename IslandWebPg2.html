Buoys are still used as markers and warnings, but are now often more active, e.g. with solar-powered lights. Wood, cork, metal and concrete have now been augmented with modern materials, including plastic composites and foams, with metal mainly used where extra strength is required, e.g. steps on large buoys. More complex buoys with onboard electronics are now important in weather forecasting, control of shipping and ocean research, including tracking effects of global warming. This expansion of activity requires a wide range of sensors, data processing and transmission devices, and power systems (usually based on solar panels), with a larger range of sizes and shapes.

Pontoons are the heavy-duty floats of the marine world and are used to build support structures such as floating bridges and work platforms. Historically pontoons were often made of rubberised fabric or metal but these have largely been replaced with plastic, typically interlocking foamed plastic modules with a solid plastic or plastic composite skin which may be connected to make any shape or size of floating platform. Simple additions such as side bars enable safety fencing, mooring posts for small boats or connection to other structures such as shipwrecks.

  <p>
Floating marinas and docks can use the same technology as pontoons but  are more specifically orientated  to boats, with a larger range of modules, such as grooved modules to take the keel of small boats. The flexibility of the modular approach to their construction means that any shape or size (i.e. in area) of structure can be rapidly built, modified and extended as requirements change, though the range of boats covered is in the small to medium rather than medium to large size.
